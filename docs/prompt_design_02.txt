Prompt/Input - 001: 
Refer the high-level-design.md file, following are the questions I have 
	refering to XML Pipeline Definition section	
	Q1. The structure propose 3 stages - a) reading of all sources b) performing all transformations c) creating output
		I presume in each of the stages the execution is based on the sequence in how the items are defined
		Example 
		<sources>
			<csv id="customer_csv" path="s3://landing/customer/*.csv" header="true" delimiter="," inferSchema="false">
					<schemaRef>schemas/customer_staging.avsc</schemaRef>
			</csv>
			<database id="customer_db" jdbcUrl="jdbc:mysql://host/db" table="customer" fetchSize="10000"/>
		</sources>
		this will first load the csv and then load the database table
		
		<transformations>
			<deduplicate source="customer_csv" keys="customer_id" keep="latest"/>
			<sort source="customer_csv" orderBy="customer_id"/>
		</transformations>
		this will first perform deduplicate and then sort
		
		the same in case of <targets> </targets>
	Q2. The structure should be able to handle scenario where no transformation is required and it is a straight through pass. Can transformation stage be blank.
	Q3. Will reading all source together lead to huge memory surge and would JIT load be better design approach
	Q4. The <database> should it support SQL instead of table name. Will that be better then doing SELECT * from table


Prompt/Output - 001:

Q1 – Execution order: The XML lists sources, transforms, and targets declaratively; the orchestrator compiles that into a DAG so it can optimise loads (e.g., JIT or parallel) rather than executing strictly top-to-bottom. For simple cases the default run order follows the listing, but dependencies (like a source named in a transform) really drive sequencing—no change needed, just be aware the engine controls the actual evaluation (docs/high-level-design.md:44).
Q2 – No-transform pipelines: Yes, support straight-through passes by allowing <transformations/> to be empty or omit the block entirely. The schema just needs to treat the transformations element as optional so extract-only or publish-only jobs are valid (docs/high-level-design.md:56).
Q3 – Memory considerations: Spark loads data lazily; even if multiple sources are declared, the engine can stream or batch them as needed. Add a loadPolicy attribute (e.g., eager vs onDemand) or source-level partition filters so large tables are fetched only when referenced, avoiding memory spikes (docs/high-level-design.md:50).
Q4 – Database reads: Prefer letting pipelines provide SQL; introduce an optional <sql><![CDATA[...]]></sql> child or queryRef so you’re not forced into SELECT *. Fall back to table when SQL isn’t supplied; this keeps flexibility for projections, filters, joins, and CDC views (docs/high-level-design.md:54).


Prompt/Input - 002:

Can you please change the design document as per the response to Q4.


Prompt/Output - 002:

Updated the database-source example to show inline SQL support and documented the table-vs-SQL option so pipelines can project/filter without defaulting to SELECT * (docs/high-level-design.md:54-82).



Prompt/Input - 003:
Refer the high-level-design.md file,Following are the feedback I have on Repository & Folder Structure section

1) the sub folder structure under data should follow the same hierarchy as applications. so data/applications/<appName>/staging & standarization & service. The actual files will be created in these last 3 folders.
2) for each transformation create it own folder and python file under transformations folder

In the high level design include the design to include point you suggested in Future Enhancements 
1. Self-service portal for business users to request new pipelines using guided wizards.

Prompt/Output - 003:
Expanded the API & orchestration layer to include a self-service portal that validates inputs, scaffolds XML, and routes approvals (docs/high-level-design.md:16-20) and added a corresponding services/self_service/ component in the repo layout (docs/high-level-design.md:121-138).
Broke out each transformation into its own subpackage with dedicated Python module under libs/transformations/ to match the requested structure (docs/high-level-design.md:121-138).
Realigned the data directory so application artifacts land under data/applications/<appName>/staging|standardization|service and noted the governance benefits in the configuration guidance (docs/high-level-design.md:157-175).
Removed the portal from “Future Enhancements,” keeping the list focused on longer-term ideas now that the portal is part of the core design (docs/high-level-design.md:209-213).
Next steps:

Review the new portal concept with UX/governance stakeholders to shape the approval workflow.
Adjust implementation backlogs or tickets to reflect the refined folder structure and transformation packaging.
