Refer the high-level-design.md file, following are the questions I have 
	refering to XML Pipeline Definition section	
	Q1. The structure propose 3 stages - a) reading of all sources b) performing all transformations c) creating output
		I presume in each of the stages the execution is based on the sequence in how the items are defined
		Example 
		<sources>
			<csv id="customer_csv" path="s3://landing/customer/*.csv" header="true" delimiter="," inferSchema="false">
					<schemaRef>schemas/customer_staging.avsc</schemaRef>
			</csv>
			<database id="customer_db" jdbcUrl="jdbc:mysql://host/db" table="customer" fetchSize="10000"/>
		</sources>
		this will first load the csv and then load the database table
		
		<transformations>
			<deduplicate source="customer_csv" keys="customer_id" keep="latest"/>
			<sort source="customer_csv" orderBy="customer_id"/>
		</transformations>
		this will first perform deduplicate and then sort
		
		the same in case of <targets> </targets>
	Q2. The structure should be able to handle scenario where no transformation is required and it is a straight through pass. Can transformation stage be blank.
	Q3. Will reading all source together lead to huge memory surge and would JIT load be better design approach
	Q4. The <database> should it support SQL instead of table name. Will that be better then doing SELECT * from table


Refer the high-level-design.md file, Following are the feedback I have on Repository & Folder Structure section

1) the sub folder structure under data should follow the same hierarchy as applications. so data/applications/<appName>/staging & standarization & service. The actual files will be created in these last 3 folders.
2) for each transformation create it own folder and python file under transformations folder

In the high level design include the design to include point you suggested in Future Enhancements 
1. Self-service portal for business users to request new pipelines using guided wizards.

Refer the high-level-design.md file, Following are the feedback I have on Repository & Folder Structure section
1) add sub folder schemas under staging & standarization & service under the config area only.

Refer the high-level-design.md file, Following are the feedback I have on XML Pipeline Definition section	
1. in the add attribute called schemaRef for <database> too both in <sources> and <targets>. this will point to the schemas folder that we created under config area.

Refer the high-level-design.md file, please update the section XML Pipeline Definition with all the possible values for attributes. example keep="latest" , mode="append"
