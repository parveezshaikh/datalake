Prompt  to create / develop "Data Hub Application"

Requirement: 
As a solution architect, provide a high-level design for a data-processing application. 

Features: 
The application should support all and more data processing components specified in the 
Transformation Supported section of the prompt - 
	• The application should provide a data pipeline component where the data processing steps can be 
configured. This component should be in xml format. 
	• The application should provide a job pipeline component where multiple data pipeline components 
execution sequence can be configured in form of dependency 
	• In production the application will handle thousands of input and output files sent or requested by 
multiple other internal applications. Hence will need to keep all configuration files input, output and 
data related to same application together. The application should also segregate the configuration into 
staging layer to load data from source to database table, standardization layer for data transformation 
on database table and finally service layer to generate output files from database table. Design the 
folder structure accordingly 

	• Scalability, Performance are key to this application, hence use appropriate design patterns and libraries 
The application should record the details on each data pipeline run and should provide a dashboard with 
operational metrics to identify run per day, success and failure and reason for failure 

Transformation Supported:
	• Input from CSV files 
	• Input from database tables 
	• Deduplication and Sorting 
	• Sorting 
	• Join 
	• Lookup 
	• Merging 
	• Rollup or Aggregation 
	• Output to CSV files 
	• Data Masking 

Technology Stack: 
	• any NoSQL database like Hive 
	• Python 
	• Dockers 
	• Python Libraries

		○ nympy 
		○ Pandas 
		○ Flask 
		○ FastAPl 

Repository: 
create a new repository called "datalake" in github.com/parveezshaikh/
